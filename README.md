# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project contains una serie de estructuras las cuales se fueron aprendiendo durante el stage 2 del programa software engineering.

- To use a more organized code model, we used blocks to separate .css files and thus keep my index.css more organized.
- I also used the @import url() method to import each block into my index.css.
- It was my first time creating a moving object in code. Using Lesson 6 on animations and special effects, I was able to create a circle with a pulse effect and simulate movement using a .about__circle_animation_blurred animation: pulsate 1.5s ease-in-out 0s infinite.
- Using the .form__button:hover background-color: #3f96f3 structure, I was able to make a color transition happen every time someone placed the mouse cursor over my boxcheck.
- The transition only worked with the following command: transition: background-color 0.5s;
